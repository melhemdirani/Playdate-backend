   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Run the quick test:**
   ```bash
   node quick-notification-test.js
   ```

### üß™ Comprehensive Testing (2 minutes)

#### Option 1: Node.js Script

```bash
node test-notifications.js
```

#### Option 2: Bash Script (Linux/Mac/WSL)

```bash
chmod +x test-notifications.sh
./test-notifications.sh
```

#### Option 3: Manual API Testing

```bash
# 1. Login first
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password123"}'

# 2. Use the token from response for notification testing
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

### 1. Test User Account

Create a test user (if not exists):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/users/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "test@example.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "username": "testuser"
  }'
```

### 2. Database Setup

Ensure your database is running and seeded with:

- Sample games
- Sample locations
- Test user data

### 3. Environment Variables

Check these are configured:

- Database connection
- JWT secret
- Expo push token (optional)
- Email configuration (optional)

## üìä Test Results Overview

After running tests, you should see:

```
üìã TEST SUMMARY:
================
‚úÖ Total notification types tested: 42
‚úÖ Successfully created: 42
‚úÖ Mark as seen tested: 5
‚úÖ Delete tested: 3
‚úÖ Final notifications count: 34
üéâ All notification features tested successfully!
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login Failed**

   - Check test user exists
   - Verify credentials in test scripts

2. **Token Expired**

   - Re-run login step
   - Check JWT secret configuration

3. **Database Errors**

   - Ensure database is running
   - Check Prisma connection

4. **Push Notification Failures**
   - Normal if no Expo tokens configured
   - Check Expo SDK setup

## üéØ Advanced Testing
